## So, what even is this? 
This is more or less a collection of password-generating algorithms. 
That's it. 

Now, they will be split into the "hobby" and "professional" folders. 

Hobby is where programmers who came up with an algorithm as a side project or learning experience can "post" them.

Professional is where actual algorithms that people should actually use reside. 

Anyways, I'll probably update this if Cracklr gains any popularity... 

Byeeee!
